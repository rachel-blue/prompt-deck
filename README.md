## [PromptDeck](https://prompt-deck-6e03d.firebaseapp.com/)
This project utilizes the Firebase and Redux to view, create, and generate writing prompts. Current project can be
viewed at the link [PromptDeck](https://prompt-deck-6e03d.firebaseapp.com/). Hosted by Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), 
using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.


## How to run the project locally
### `Local Setup`
1. Install Node.js (recommended version v13.4.0)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `npm install` in the cloned repo's root
4. Run `npm start` to view the locally hosted site in the browser

### `Development server`
Run `npm start` for a dev server. 
Page will automatically open in browser, 
or navigate to http://localhost:300 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Create a Build`
Run `npm run build` to build the project for produciton. The build artifacts will be stored
in the `build/` directory. 

## Project Notes
### `Thought Process`


### `With more time`




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
